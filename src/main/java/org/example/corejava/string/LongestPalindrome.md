Here’s a simple and clear explanation of how to solve the **Longest Palindromic Substring** problem using the "Expand Around Center" approach, perfect for interviews:

### **Problem**:
Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

### **Approach**: Expand Around Center

**Key Concept**:
- A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
- The idea is to treat each character (or pair of characters) as the center of a potential palindrome and expand outwards to check if it forms a valid palindrome.
- For each character in the string, check both **odd-length** (single character center) and **even-length** (two-character center) palindromes.

---

### **Steps**:

1. **Expand from Center**:
    - For each character in the string, try to expand outward from that character (or between two characters for even-length palindromes).
    - While expanding, if the characters on the left and right are the same, continue expanding; otherwise, stop.

2. **Track the Longest Palindrome**:
    - Keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found.
    - Update these indices whenever a longer palindrome is found during expansion.

3. **Time Complexity**:
    - Since we expand from the center for each character, and for each expansion, we potentially cover all characters, the overall time complexity is **O(n²)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

### **Code Explanation**:

```java
public class LongestPalindromicSubstring {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(longestPalindrome("babad")); // Output: "bab" or "aba"
        System.out.println(longestPalindrome("cbbd"));  // Output: "bb"
    }

    public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) {
            return "";
        }
        
        int start = 0, end = 0; // To keep track of the start and end of the longest palindrome
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);       // Case 1: Odd-length palindrome
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);   // Case 2: Even-length palindrome
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2); // Get the maximum length found
            if (len > end - start) {        // Update start and end if a longer palindrome is found
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }
        
        return s.substring(start, end + 1); // Return the longest palindromic substring
    }

    private static int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        // Expand as long as the characters on the left and right are the same
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1; // Return the length of the palindrome found
    }
}
```

### **Example 1**:

- **Input**: `"babad"`
- **Explanation**:
    - Expand around index 0 (`b`), finds a palindrome `"bab"`.
    - Expand around index 1 (`a`), finds `"aba"`.
    - Both `"bab"` and `"aba"` are valid answers.
- **Output**: `"bab"` (or `"aba"`)

---

### **Example 2**:

- **Input**: `"cbbd"`
- **Explanation**:
    - Expand around index 1 (`b`), finds a palindrome `"bb"`.
    - No longer palindrome is found.
- **Output**: `"bb"`

---

### **Key Points for Interviews**:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n²)** due to the two nested loops (one for iterating over each character and one for expanding).
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (excluding the space used to store the result).
- **Why Expand Around Center?**: It's a simple and efficient way to check all possible palindromes in the string without using additional space (like dynamic programming tables).
