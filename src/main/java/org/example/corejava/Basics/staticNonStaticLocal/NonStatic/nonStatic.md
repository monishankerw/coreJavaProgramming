In Java, **non-static (or instance) variables and methods** are associated with individual objects, not the class itself. Each instance of a class has its own copy of non-static variables and can call non-static methods independently of other instances.

### 1. **Non-Static (Instance) Variables**
- **Definition**: A non-static variable is a variable declared without the `static` keyword, meaning each instance of the class has its own copy of this variable.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Unique to each instance: If one object modifies its non-static variable, it doesn’t affect the variable in other objects of the same class.
    - Stored in the heap memory as part of the object.
    - Commonly used for attributes that vary across objects, such as `name`, `age`, or `balance` in a `Person` or `Account` class.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  public class Person {
      public String name; // Non-static variable
      public int age;     // Non-static variable

      public Person(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }
  }

  // Usage
  Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
  Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

  System.out.println(person1.name); // Outputs: Alice
  System.out.println(person2.name); // Outputs: Bob
  ```

  In this example, `person1` and `person2` each have their own `name` and `age` variables with unique values.

### 2. **Non-Static (Instance) Methods**
- **Definition**: A non-static method (or instance method) is a method declared without the `static` keyword, which operates on instances of a class.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Can access both static and non-static variables and methods within the class.
    - Requires an object instance to be called.
    - Used for behaviors that operate on the instance’s own data, such as modifying or retrieving instance-specific data.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  public class Car {
      public String model;  // Non-static variable
      public int speed;     // Non-static variable

      // Constructor
      public Car(String model, int speed) {
          this.model = model;
          this.speed = speed;
      }

      // Non-static method
      public void accelerate(int increment) {
          speed += increment;
          System.out.println(model + " accelerated to " + speed + " km/h");
      }

      // Non-static method
      public void displayInfo() {
          System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Speed: " + speed + " km/h");
      }
  }

  // Usage
  Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", 50);
  Car car2 = new Car("Honda", 60);

  car1.accelerate(20);  // Toyota accelerated to 70 km/h
  car2.accelerate(15);  // Honda accelerated to 75 km/h
  car1.displayInfo();   // Model: Toyota, Speed: 70 km/h
  car2.displayInfo();   // Model: Honda, Speed: 75 km/h
  ```

  In this example:
    - `car1` and `car2` each have their own `model` and `speed` variables.
    - The `accelerate` method, being non-static, operates on the specific instance it’s called on, modifying that instance’s `speed` variable.

### Summary

| Feature                   | Non-Static Variable                                | Non-Static Method                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Belongs To**            | Instance of the class (each object has its own)    | Instance of the class (called on objects)          |
| **Access**                | Requires an instance to access                     | Requires an instance to call                       |
| **Access to Class Members** | Can access both static and non-static members      | Can access both static and non-static members      |
| **Purpose**               | Stores instance-specific data                      | Defines behaviors operating on instance-specific data |

### Key Points
- **Non-Static Variables**: Each instance has its own copy; changes affect only that instance.
- **Non-Static Methods**: Require an object to be called and can operate on that object’s data, allowing for object-specific behavior.
