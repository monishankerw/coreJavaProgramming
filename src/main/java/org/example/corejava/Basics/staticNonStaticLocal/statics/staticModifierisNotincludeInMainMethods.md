Q. What happens if the static modifier is not included in the main method signature in Java?

If the `static` modifier is not included in the `main` method signature in Java, the program will compile, but it will not run. 
This is because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) expects a specific signature for the main method, which is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

The `main` method must be `static` so that the JVM can invoke it without needing to create an instance of the class. Hereâ€™s what happens if `static` is omitted:

### Error Message
If you remove `static` from the `main` method, the program will throw an error when you try to run it. For example:

```java
public class MainWithoutStatic {
    public void main(String[] args) { // Missing 'static'
        System.out.println("This will cause a runtime error!");
    }
}
```

Attempting to run this code will produce the following error:

```plaintext
Error: Main method not found in class MainWithoutStatic, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
```

### Why the Error Occurs
1. **JVM Requirement**: The JVM specifically looks for `public static void main(String[] args)` as the entry point. Without `static`, it cannot call `main` directly on the class without creating an instance.
2. **Instance Method**: Without `static`, `main` becomes an instance method, which requires an object to be called. The JVM has no way to automatically create an instance of the class before calling `main`, creating a circular dependency.

### Summary
- If `static` is missing, the program will compile but not run, resulting in an error at runtime.
- The `main` method must be `static` so that it can be called by the JVM without creating an instance of the class, allowing the program to start properly.
