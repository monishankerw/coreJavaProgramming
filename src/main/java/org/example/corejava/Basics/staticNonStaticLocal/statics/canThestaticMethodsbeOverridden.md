Q. Can the static methods be overridden?

No, **static methods cannot be overridden in Java**. 
However, they can be *hidden* by a subclass if a static method with the same signature is defined in the subclass. 
Here's why and how this works:

### Why Static Methods Cannot Be Overridden
1. **Binding at Compile-Time**: Static methods are bound to the class at compile time, not to instances of the class. Since static methods belong to the class itself rather than any object instance, they cannot participate in dynamic method dispatch, which is essential for polymorphism and overriding.

2. **Inheritance Without Overriding**: Although a subclass can define a static method with the same signature as the static method in the superclass, this is called *method hiding*, not overriding. When you call a static method, the method that gets executed is determined by the type of the reference at compile time, not by the actual object at runtime.

### Example: Method Hiding with Static Methods

Here’s an example showing how method hiding works with static methods in Java:

```java
class Parent {
    // Static method in parent class
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Static method in child class with the same signature
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Child class");
    }
}

public class StaticMethodTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Parent();
        Parent c = new Child();

        p.display(); // Calls Parent's display method
        c.display(); // Calls Parent's display method due to method hiding
        Child.display(); // Calls Child's display method directly
    }
}
```

### Output

```plaintext
Static method in Parent class
Static method in Parent class
Static method in Child class
```

### Explanation of Output

1. `p.display()` calls `Parent`'s `display` method.
2. `c.display()` also calls `Parent`'s `display` method, even though `c` is of type `Child`, because the method call is resolved based on the reference type (`Parent`).
3. `Child.display()` directly calls `Child`'s `display` method, showing the *method hiding* effect.

### Summary

- **Static methods cannot be overridden** because they are not part of an instance's behavior.
- A subclass can define a static method with the same signature, but this is **method hiding** rather than overriding.
- At runtime, the static method that is executed is determined by the reference type, not the object type, as with instance method overriding.

Q. In java, static as wll as pravite method overriding is possible.?
In Java, **neither static methods nor private methods can be overridden** in the true sense. Here’s why:

### 1. **Static Methods Cannot Be Overridden (Only Hidden)**
- **Reason**: Static methods belong to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. They are resolved at compile-time rather than runtime (known as static binding).
- **Outcome**: If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as one in the superclass, this is called *method hiding*, not overriding.

   ```java
   class Parent {
       public static void display() {
           System.out.println("Static method in Parent class");
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
       public static void display() {
           System.out.println("Static method in Child class");
       }
   }

   public class TestStatic {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent parent = new Child();
           parent.display(); // Outputs "Static method in Parent class"
           Child.display();  // Outputs "Static method in Child class"
       }
   }
   ```

In the example above:
- `parent.display()` calls the `Parent`'s `display` method because static methods are resolved by the reference type (`Parent`).
- `Child.display()` directly calls the `Child`'s `display` method, hiding the `Parent` method rather than overriding it.

### 2. **Private Methods Cannot Be Overridden (Only Scoped to the Class)**
- **Reason**: Private methods are not inherited by subclasses. Since they are not visible outside their declaring class, they do not participate in polymorphism.
- **Outcome**: If a subclass defines a method with the same name and signature as a private method in the superclass, it is treated as a new, separate method rather than an overridden version.

   ```java
   class Parent {
       private void show() {
           System.out.println("Private method in Parent class");
       }

       public void callShow() {
           show(); // Calls Parent's show() method
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
       private void show() {
           System.out.println("Private method in Child class");
       }
       
       public void callChildShow() {
           show(); // Calls Child's show() method
       }
   }

   public class TestPrivate {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent parent = new Parent();
           Child child = new Child();

           parent.callShow();      // Outputs "Private method in Parent class"
           child.callShow();       // Outputs "Private method in Parent class" due to Parent's callShow() method
           child.callChildShow();  // Outputs "Private method in Child class"
       }
   }
   ```

In this example:
- The `show()` method in `Parent` and `Child` are completely separate due to the `private` access modifier.
- `parent.callShow()` calls the `show()` method within `Parent`, while `child.callChildShow()` calls the `show()` method defined within `Child`.

### Summary
- **Static Methods**: Can be hidden by defining a new static method with the same signature in a subclass, but this is method hiding, not overriding.
- **Private Methods**: Cannot be overridden because they are not inherited by subclasses.
