Here is an overview of the hierarchy for Collection and Collections in Java:

1. Collection Interface Hierarchy

The Collection interface is the root of the collection framework, and various subinterfaces and classes implement it to provide different types of data structures.

java.util.Collection (Interface)
├── java.util.List (Interface)
│   ├── java.util.ArrayList
│   ├── java.util.LinkedList
│   ├── java.util.Vector
│       └── java.util.Stack
├── java.util.Set (Interface)
│   ├── java.util.HashSet
│   ├── java.util.LinkedHashSet
│   └── java.util.SortedSet (Interface)
│       └── java.util.TreeSet
└── java.util.Queue (Interface)
├── java.util.PriorityQueue
└── java.util.Deque (Interface)
├── java.util.ArrayDeque
└── java.util.LinkedList

	•	List: Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Examples include ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.
	•	Set: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates. Examples include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
	•	Queue: Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. Examples include PriorityQueue and ArrayDeque.
	•	Deque: Double-ended queue, allowing insertion and deletion from both ends. Examples include ArrayDeque and LinkedList.

2. Collections Class Hierarchy

The Collections class is a utility class that provides static methods for performing operations on collections. This includes sorting, searching, and other utilities for manipulation.

java.util.Collections (Class)
├── Static utility methods for:
│   ├── Sorting (sort)
│   ├── Searching (binarySearch)
│   ├── Synchronizing (synchronizedCollection, synchronizedList, synchronizedSet, synchronizedMap)
│   ├── Unmodifiable collections (unmodifiableCollection, unmodifiableList, unmodifiableSet, unmodifiableMap)
│   ├── Reverse order (reverse)
│   └── Filling, shuffling, min/max, etc.

	•	Sorting: Collections.sort(list) for sorting a list.
	•	Searching: Collections.binarySearch(list, key) for searching a list.
	•	Synchronization: Methods like synchronizedCollection() to make a collection thread-safe.
	•	Unmodifiable Collections: unmodifiableCollection() to create read-only versions of collections.
	•	Other Utilities: Methods for reversing, shuffling, filling collections, and finding min/max elements.

In summary:
•	Collection is the core interface with subinterfaces (List, Set, Queue) and implementations.
•	Collections is a utility class offering methods for common operations on collections.
