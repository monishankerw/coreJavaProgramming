Collection: Any group of individual objects which are represent as a single unit is know as a collection of objects.
       ->It is an interface.
       ->It stores serveral an object as single entily.
       ->Collection gives us radimate data structure.
       ->Size of collection is dynamics.
       ->store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
       ->memory more efficient.
       ->He got underlying data structure to simplify our work.
       ->java.util.collection(jdk1.2)

       1. Difference between Collection and Collections.
       Collection
       ->It is an interface.
       ->It stores serveral an object as single entily.

       Collections
       ->It is a class.
       ->It is a utility class that's helps us to perform operations like sorting,searching on object present inside collection.

       2. Difference between Array and Collections.
       Array
       ->It is fixed size.
       ->Store only homogeneous data.
       ->Memory usage it is less efficient.
       ->No underlying data structure.

       Collection
       ->Size of collection is dynamics.
       ->store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
       ->memory more efficient.
       ->He got underlying data structure to simplify our work.

Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the information provided:

1. Which of the following statements is true about the Collection interface?

   •	A. It is a class.
   •	B. It only stores homogeneous data.
   •	C. It represents a group of individual objects as a single unit.
   •	D. It is part of the java.io package.

Answer: C. It represents a group of individual objects as a single unit.

2. Which of the following best describes Collections?

   •	A. It is an interface for storing objects.
   •	B. It is a class that provides utility methods for operations like sorting and searching.
   •	C. It is a fixed-size data structure.
   •	D. It is part of java.io package.

Answer: B. It is a class that provides utility methods for operations like sorting and searching.

3. What is a key difference between an array and a Collection?

   •	A. An array has dynamic size, whereas a Collection has a fixed size.
   •	B. Arrays are more memory-efficient than collections.
   •	C. Collections can only store homogeneous data, while arrays can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
   •	D. Arrays have underlying data structures, whereas collections do not.

Answer: B. Arrays are more memory-efficient than collections.

4. Which of the following is true about a Collection in Java?

   •	A. It is size-fixed.
   •	B. It can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
   •	C. It is always faster than arrays in terms of memory usage.
   •	D. It is only available in JDK 1.5 and above.

Answer: B. It can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.

5. The Collections class in Java is primarily used for:

   •	A. Storing data in a fixed-size structure.
   •	B. Performing utility operations such as sorting and searching on collections.
   •	C. Representing a collection of objects as a single unit.
   •	D. Defining the properties of various data structures.

Answer: B. Performing utility operations such as sorting and searching on collections.

6. Which of the following is NOT true about arrays?

   •	A. Arrays are of fixed size.
   •	B. Arrays can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
   •	C. Arrays are generally less memory-efficient than collections.
   •	D. Arrays lack underlying data structures for complex operations.

Answer: B. Arrays can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.

7. The Collection interface was introduced in which version of Java?

   •	A. JDK 1.0
   •	B. JDK 1.1
   •	C. JDK 1.2
   •	D. JDK 1.5

Answer: C. JDK 1.2

8. Which statement is true about memory usage in Collection vs. Array?

   •	A. Arrays use memory more efficiently than collections.
   •	B. Collections use memory more efficiently than arrays.
   •	C. Both arrays and collections use memory equally.
   •	D. Collections can only be memory-efficient if they store homogeneous data.

Answer: B. Collections use memory more efficiently than arrays.
