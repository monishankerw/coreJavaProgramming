`ConcurrentHashMap` and `WeakHashMap` are both part of Java's `Map` interface but serve different purposes and have different behaviors, especially regarding **concurrency**, **key-value management**, and **memory management**. Hereâ€™s how they relate and differ:

### Key Differences Between `ConcurrentHashMap` and `WeakHashMap`:

1. **Thread-Safety**:
    - **ConcurrentHashMap**: It is **thread-safe** and designed to handle concurrent access by multiple threads. It uses fine-grained locking (lock striping) to allow high concurrency.
    - **WeakHashMap**: It is **not thread-safe** and requires external synchronization if used in a multithreaded environment.

2. **Garbage Collection (Weak References)**:
    - **ConcurrentHashMap**: Does **not** involve weak references. Keys and values are strongly referenced, so they are not eligible for garbage collection as long as there is a reference to them.
    - **WeakHashMap**: Uses **weak references** for keys. If the key object has no strong references elsewhere, the key-value pair is automatically removed from the map during garbage collection. This makes `WeakHashMap` useful for caches or memory-sensitive applications.

3. **Use Case**:
    - **ConcurrentHashMap**: Useful in scenarios where multiple threads need to modify or access the map concurrently (e.g., real-time applications, multi-threaded caches, or shared resources).
    - **WeakHashMap**: Useful for scenarios where you want the map entries to be automatically removed when the key is no longer in use, such as in memory-sensitive caching or resource management.

4. **Handling `null` Values**:
    - **ConcurrentHashMap**: Does **not allow `null` keys or values**. Inserting a `null` key or value will throw a `NullPointerException`.
    - **WeakHashMap**: **Allows `null` values** (but not `null` keys), similar to a regular `HashMap`.

5. **Concurrency and Iteration**:
    - **ConcurrentHashMap**: Supports high concurrency with operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `replace()`, and thread-safe iteration without locking the entire map.
    - **WeakHashMap**: Iteration is not thread-safe, and the entries may be removed asynchronously by the garbage collector, which can lead to some complexity when iterating.

### When to Use Each:

- **Use `ConcurrentHashMap`**: When you need a high-performance, thread-safe map that will be accessed and modified concurrently by multiple threads. For example, a cache or shared resource map in a multi-threaded application.

- **Use `WeakHashMap`**: When you need a memory-sensitive map where entries should be automatically removed when their keys are no longer referenced by any part of the application. This is useful for caching objects where you want to free up memory as soon as the keys are no longer in use.

### Code Comparison:

#### `ConcurrentHashMap` Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        map.put("A", 1);
        map.put("B", 2);
        
        // Thread-safe concurrent modification
        map.putIfAbsent("C", 3);
        map.replace("A", 1, 10);

        // Safe iteration
        map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + " -> " + value));
    }
}
```

#### `WeakHashMap` Example:
```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.WeakHashMap;

public class WeakHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new WeakHashMap<>();
        
        // Create a key object
        String key1 = new String("A");
        map.put(key1, 1);
        map.put("B", 2);

        // key1 is weakly referenced
        System.out.println("Before GC: " + map);

        // Make the key1 eligible for garbage collection
        key1 = null;
        
        // Request garbage collection
        System.gc();
        
        // Wait a bit to let GC happen
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        // After GC, the weakly referenced key "A" should be removed
        System.out.println("After GC: " + map);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of `WeakHashMap` Example:
- In this example, `"A"` is weakly referenced. After setting `key1 = null` and running the garbage collector, the entry `"A"` -> `1` may be removed from the map. This happens because there are no strong references to the key `"A"`, so it becomes eligible for garbage collection, and `WeakHashMap` automatically removes it.

### Summary of Relation:

- Both are specialized implementations of the `Map` interface but serve different purposes:
    - **`ConcurrentHashMap`** focuses on **thread-safety** and **concurrency**.
    - **`WeakHashMap`** focuses on **automatic garbage collection** of unused keys and **memory efficiency**.

You can use them together in certain scenarios: for example, using a `WeakHashMap` for cache entries that expire based on memory pressure, and a `ConcurrentHashMap` for real-time processing requiring high concurrency.
