### Key Points to Mention in an Interview:

1. **Definition**:  
   A thread-safe, high-performance map implementation designed for concurrent use in multithreaded environments.

2. **Thread-Safety**:  
   Allows concurrent reads and writes without locking the entire map, using internal mechanisms like lock striping.

3. **Fine-Grained Locking (Lock Striping)**:  
   Instead of locking the whole map, `ConcurrentHashMap` locks only certain segments or buckets of the map, allowing higher concurrency for multiple threads.

4. **No `null` Keys or Values**:  
   Unlike `HashMap`, `ConcurrentHashMap` does not permit `null` keys or values. This avoids ambiguity with operations like `get()` returning `null`.

5. **Performance**:  
   Highly efficient in environments where reads significantly outnumber writes. It uses internal optimizations to minimize blocking during reads.

6. **Concurrent Methods**:  
   It provides atomic methods such as `putIfAbsent()`, `replace()`, `computeIfAbsent()`, which simplify thread-safe operations.

7. **Non-blocking Reads**:  
   Most read operations are non-blocking, allowing very high concurrency, especially in read-heavy workloads.

8. **Partial Locking During Write Operations**:  
   Write operations lock only the bucket affected, allowing multiple threads to write to different segments concurrently.

9. **Iteration**:  
   Iteration over a `ConcurrentHashMap` is weakly consistent, meaning it may reflect some but not all of the changes made to the map after the iterator was created. It does not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a ConcurrentHashMap instance
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        
        // Adding entries to the map
        map.put("A", 1);
        map.put("B", 2);
        map.put("C", 3);
        
        // Concurrent access example: Simulate concurrent threads performing operations
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            map.put("D", 4);
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Added D -> 4");
        });
        
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            Integer value = map.get("B");
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Read B -> " + value);
        });

        // Start both threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Ensure both threads finish execution
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Atomic operation using putIfAbsent
        map.putIfAbsent("A", 10);  // Won't overwrite the value for "A"
        System.out.println("After putIfAbsent: A -> " + map.get("A"));  // Output: A -> 1
        
        // Replacing value for a key
        map.replace("B", 20);  // Will replace value for "B"
        System.out.println("After replace: B -> " + map.get("B"));  // Output: B -> 20

        // Iterating over the map
        System.out.println("Map entries:");
        map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + " -> " + value));
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation:
1. **Concurrent Operations**:
    - **Thread 1** adds a new entry (`D -> 4`), while **Thread 2** reads an existing value (`B -> 2`).
    - These operations can occur concurrently, demonstrating how `ConcurrentHashMap` manages safe parallel access.

2. **Atomic Methods**:
    - `putIfAbsent("A", 10)` ensures that if the key "A" already has a value, it wonâ€™t be replaced.
    - `replace("B", 20)` replaces the value for key "B" atomically.

3. **Iteration**:
    - The map is iterated using the `forEach` method. The iteration reflects the current state of the map, but it's weakly consistent (may not include updates made during iteration).

### Expected Output:
```
Thread 1: Added D -> 4
Thread 2: Read B -> 2
After putIfAbsent: A -> 1
After replace: B -> 20
Map entries:
A -> 1
B -> 20
C -> 3
D -> 4
```
