For an interview, you might want to focus on how you explain methods in Java, highlighting key concepts like instance methods, static methods, final methods, and abstract methods. Below is an enhanced version of the code, tailored for interview purposes, along with an explanation to help you answer questions about Java methods.

### Java Methods Example for Interview:

```java
// Class demonstrating various types of methods in Java
public class MethodExample {

    // 1. Instance method: adds two numbers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // 2. Static method: calculates the square of a number
    public static int square(int number) {
        return number * number;
    }

    // 3. Final method: displays a message (cannot be overridden)
    public final void displayFinalMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method. It cannot be overridden.");
    }

    // 4. Private method: only accessible within this class
    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a private method.");
    }

    // 5. Method with no return type (void)
    public void displayWelcomeMessage() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Methods!");
    }

    // Main method to run the program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of the class to call instance methods
        MethodExample example = new MethodExample();
        
        // Calling instance method
        int sum = example.add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        // Calling static method
        int squaredValue = MethodExample.square(5);
        System.out.println("Square of 5: " + squaredValue);

        // Calling final method
        example.displayFinalMessage();

        // Calling void method
        example.displayWelcomeMessage();
        
        // Private method can only be called within the class (example here)
        example.privateMethod();
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts for Interview Explanation:

1. **Instance Method**:
    - **What is it?** A method that belongs to an instance of the class.
    - **Example**: `public int add(int a, int b)` requires creating an object of the class to invoke it.

2. **Static Method**:
    - **What is it?** A method that belongs to the class itself rather than to any instance. It can be invoked without creating an object.
    - **Example**: `public static int square(int number)` can be called using `MethodExample.square(5)`.

3. **Final Method**:
    - **What is it?** A method that cannot be overridden by subclasses.
    - **Example**: `public final void displayFinalMessage()`. If you try to override this method in a subclass, the compiler will throw an error.

4. **Private Method**:
    - **What is it?** A method that is only accessible within the class in which it is declared. It cannot be accessed from outside this class.
    - **Example**: `private void privateMethod()` can only be called from within `MethodExample`.

5. **Void Method**:
    - **What is it?** A method that does not return any value. It is used to perform some operation or task.
    - **Example**: `public void displayWelcomeMessage()` is an example of a method that returns no value.

6. **Method Signature**:
    - Every method has a signature that includes the method's name, return type, and parameter list.
    - Example signature: `public int add(int a, int b)`. This method's name is `add`, return type is `int`, and it accepts two `int` parameters.

### Points to Cover in an Interview:
- **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods in a class can have the same name but different parameters (type, number, or both).

   ```java
   public int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   public double add(double a, double b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

- **Return Types**: Explain how different methods can return different types (`int`, `void`, `String`, etc.). For example, the `add()` method returns an `int`, and `displayWelcomeMessage()` has no return type (`void`).

- **Access Modifiers**: Explain how methods can have different access levels using `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default (package-private).

This code and explanation will help you demonstrate a thorough understanding of methods during your interview.
