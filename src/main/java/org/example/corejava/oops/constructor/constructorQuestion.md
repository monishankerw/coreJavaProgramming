Q. What is a private constructor?
We can hava the private constructors in java.
To make or create a constructor as private, user the private user the private keyword while declaring it.
It can only be accessed within that class.

The following are same usage scenarios when we need a private constructor:
1. Internal Constructor Chaining
2. Singleton class design pattern

Q. Do we have a copy constructor in Java?
Java does not have a built-in copy constructor.
However, you can create one by defining a constructor that takes an instance of the same class and copies its fields. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int data;

    // Copy constructor
    public MyClass(MyClass other) {
        this.data = other.data;
    }
}
```

This lets you create a copy like:

```java
MyClass original = new MyClass(10);
MyClass copy = new MyClass(original);
```

Alternatively, Javaâ€™s `clone()` method can be used, but it requires implementing `Cloneable` and handling deep copies yourself.
