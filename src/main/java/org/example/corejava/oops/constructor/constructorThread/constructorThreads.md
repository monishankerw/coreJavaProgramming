The code you provided contains some syntax errors. In Java, you cannot have a `try-catch` block directly within the class body like that. To achieve the intended behavior, you should place the `try-catch` inside the constructor, not outside.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
package org.example.corejava.oops.constructor.constructorThread;

public class Test implements Runnable {

    // Constructor with sleep inside a try-catch block
    public Test() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);  // Pauses the constructor for 5 seconds
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread Running:");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test test = new Test(); // Constructor will pause here for 5 seconds
        Thread thread = new Thread(test);
        thread.start();
        System.out.println("abc");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Move `try-catch` into the Constructor**: The `try-catch` block is now within the `Test` constructor, which pauses execution in the constructor for 5 seconds.
2. **Constructor Code**: Now the constructor has a `Thread.sleep(5000);` inside `try-catch`, so it will wait 5 seconds before completing, but it does not impact the thread creation and starting behavior afterward.

### Expected Output

When you run this code, you will see:
1. The program waits 5 seconds when creating the `Test` object due to `Thread.sleep(5000);` in the constructor.
2. After the delay, `"abc"` is printed.
3. Finally, `"Thread Running:"` is printed when the `run()` method executes.
