# Throwing an Exception from a Static Block in Java

In Java, exceptions can be thrown from a static block. However, there are some important rules to keep in mind:

- **Unchecked exceptions** (i.e., exceptions that inherit from `RuntimeException`) can be thrown directly from a static block.
- **Checked exceptions** must be handled within the static block because static blocks are not methods, and they do not have a method signature where exceptions can be declared.

Q. Can we throw an exception from a static block?
Yes, exceptions can be thrown from a static block. 
However, only unchecked exceptions can be thrown directly from a static block 
because checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in a method signature. 
Since static blocks are not methods, checked exceptions must be handled within the block.
## Example: Throwing an Unchecked Exception from a Static Block

In the following example, an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) is thrown from the static block. Since this is an unchecked exception, it doesn't need to be handled or declared.

```java
public class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println("Inside static block");
        throw new RuntimeException("Unchecked exception from static block");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This will not execute");
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Inside static block
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Unchecked exception from static block
    at Test.<clinit>(Test.java:4)
```

### Explanation:
- When the class is loaded, the static block is executed before the `main` method.
- In this case, the static block throws a `RuntimeException`, which is an unchecked exception.
- As a result, the program terminates, and the `main` method is not executed.

## Key Points:
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: You can throw unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException` and its subclasses) from a static block without handling them.
- **Checked Exceptions**: If you want to throw a checked exception (like `IOException`), you must catch it inside the static block since there's no way to declare exceptions for a static block.
- **Program Termination**: If an unchecked exception is thrown from a static block, the program will terminate, and any subsequent code (like the `main` method) will not be executed.

## Conclusion:
Static blocks can throw exceptions, but only unchecked exceptions can be thrown without explicit handling. Checked exceptions must be caught within the static block because there's no way to declare exceptions for it.
