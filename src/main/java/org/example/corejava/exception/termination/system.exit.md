What happens if System.exit() is called in a try block?
When System.exit() is called, the JVM will terminate the program, and no further code (including catch and finally blocks) will be executed.

Example:


public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
System.out.println("Inside try block");
System.exit(0); // JVM will terminate here
} catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Inside catch block");
} finally {
System.out.println("Inside finally block");
}
System.out.println("This will not execute");
}
}
Output:

Inside try block
The finally block will not execute, and the program will terminate after System.exit(0).
