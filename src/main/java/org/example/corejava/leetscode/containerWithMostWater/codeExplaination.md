Sure! Let's break down the corrected code step by step:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
```
- **`class Solution`**: Defines the class `Solution` which contains the method to solve the problem.
- **`public int maxArea(int[] height)`**: This is a method named `maxArea` that takes an array of integers `height` as input and returns an integer representing the maximum area of water a container can store. The method is declared `public`, meaning it can be accessed outside this class.

```java
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
```
- **`int left = 0;`**: Initializes the `left` pointer at index 0, which points to the first element of the array. This will move from left to right as we progress.
- **`int right = height.length - 1;`**: Initializes the `right` pointer at the last index of the array (i.e., `height.length - 1`). This will move from right to left.
- **`int max = 0;`**: Initializes a variable `max` to 0. This will store the maximum area found during the loop.

```java
        while (left < right) {
```
- **`while (left < right)`**: This is the main loop that continues as long as the `left` pointer is to the left of the `right` pointer. When `left` equals `right`, it means all possible container widths have been checked.

```java
            int lh = height[left];
            int rh = height[right];
```
- **`int lh = height[left];`**: Fetches the height at the `left` pointer and stores it in `lh`.
- **`int rh = height[right];`**: Fetches the height at the `right` pointer and stores it in `rh`.

```java
            int min_h = Math.min(lh, rh);
```
- **`int min_h = Math.min(lh, rh);`**: Calculates the minimum of the two heights `lh` and `rh`. This is because the container's height is determined by the shorter line (since water can't rise above the shorter line).

```java
            int width = right - left;
```
- **`int width = right - left;`**: Calculates the width of the container, which is the horizontal distance between the `left` and `right` pointers. The width is simply the difference between the indices of the two pointers.

```java
            max = Math.max(max, min_h * width);
```
- **`max = Math.max(max, min_h * width);`**: Calculates the area of the container by multiplying the `min_h` (container height) and the `width`. It then updates `max` if this new area is greater than the current maximum area. The method `Math.max(a, b)` returns the larger of the two values `a` and `b`.

```java
            if (lh < rh) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
```
- **`if (lh < rh)`**: If the height at `left` (`lh`) is smaller than the height at `right` (`rh`), we move the `left` pointer to the right by one (`left++`). This is because moving the smaller height might give a larger container in the next iteration (moving the larger height would only shrink the width without gaining height).
- **`else`**: If `lh` is greater than or equal to `rh`, we move the `right` pointer to the left (`right--`). This is done to potentially find a taller line on the right side that can help increase the container's height.

```java
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
- **`}`**: Closes the loop and method.
- **`return max;`**: After the loop finishes, the maximum area found is returned as the result.

### Summary of how the algorithm works:
1. **Two-pointer approach**: We start with two pointers at both ends of the array (`left` and `right`). The width between them is the maximum at the start.
2. **Maximizing area**: We calculate the area for the current left and right pointers, then move the pointer corresponding to the shorter height (since a taller height can potentially form a larger container if it finds another tall line).
3. **Stopping condition**: The loop stops when the two pointers meet, meaning we've checked all possible container widths.
4. **Return the result**: The maximum area found during the loop is returned.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array, because both pointers only move inward once, and every element is processed at most once.
