For a developer with 4 years of experience, Java threading questions would likely focus on more advanced aspects, including concurrent programming patterns, synchronization mechanisms, thread lifecycle management, and troubleshooting. Here are some questions that would be appropriate for this level:

### 1. Basic Threading Concepts
- **What is the difference between `Thread` and `Runnable` in Java?**
- **How do you create a thread in Java?** Explain different ways to start a thread.
- **What are the different thread states in Java?** Describe each state in the lifecycle of a thread.

### 2. Synchronization and Concurrency
- **What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword?** Where would you use it?
- **How does `synchronized` work internally in Java?**
- **Explain the concept of a "race condition."** How do you avoid it in multi-threaded programming?
- **What are `wait()` and `notify()` methods?** Describe a scenario where you would use them.
- **What are `volatile` variables?** How do they differ from `synchronized`?

### 3. Concurrency Utilities (Java.util.concurrent)
- **What is a `CountDownLatch` and how does it work?**
- **Explain the use and benefits of a `CyclicBarrier`.**
- **What is a `Semaphore`?** Give an example of where it might be useful.
- **What is an `ExecutorService`?** How does it differ from creating individual threads?
- **What is the difference between `FixedThreadPool` and `CachedThreadPool`?**

### 4. Advanced Threading and Best Practices
- **What is deadlock?** How do you identify and resolve it in Java?
- **What are the differences between `ReentrantLock` and the `synchronized` keyword?**
- **Explain the concept of "ThreadLocal" variables in Java.** When would you use them?
- **How do you handle exceptions in threads?** Explain how exceptions are propagated in threads.
- **What is the `ForkJoinPool` and how does it work?** Describe a scenario where it would be advantageous.

### 5. Parallel Streams and CompletableFuture
- **How do Java 8 streams support parallel processing?** What are some limitations of using parallel streams?
- **What is `CompletableFuture` in Java?** Describe its advantages over traditional callback mechanisms.
- **How do you handle exceptions in `CompletableFuture` chains?**

### 6. Troubleshooting and Optimization
- **How would you identify performance issues in a multi-threaded application?**
- **What tools would you use to debug thread-related issues?**
