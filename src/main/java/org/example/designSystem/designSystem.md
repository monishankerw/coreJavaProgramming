Software design refers to the process of planning and defining the architecture, 
components, interfaces, and data for a software system to satisfy specified requirements.
It bridges the gap between requirements and code by creating a blueprint that guides the development team through the implementation process.

Software design can be broken down into multiple layers and phases,
with high-level design (architecture) and low-level design (detailed design) being the primary distinctions.

Key Aspects of Software Design
Modularity

Definition: Dividing a software system into smaller, manageable modules or components that can be developed independently.
Benefit: Improves maintainability, testability, and reusability of the codebase.

Abstraction

Definition: Hiding the complexity of the system by focusing on the essential characteristics, leaving out the unnecessary details.
Benefit: Simplifies design, allowing developers to focus on high-level interactions rather than low-level details.
Encapsulation

Definition: Restricting direct access to some of the object's components and providing controlled access through public methods.
Benefit: Improves modularity and prevents external components from being tightly coupled with internal logic.
Separation of Concerns

Definition: Dividing a program into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate concern (or functionality).
Benefit: Reduces complexity, as each section can be worked on independently.
Cohesion and Coupling

Cohesion: The degree to which elements of a module belong together. High cohesion within modules leads to better maintainability.
Coupling: The degree to which modules are dependent on each other. Low coupling means changes in one module have minimal impact on others.
